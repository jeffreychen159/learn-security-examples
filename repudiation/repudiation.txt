- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

The vulnerability here is that there is nothing tracking the messages that one 
can send. In the secure version, by having this log tracking the messages, it can 
limit ones messages where bots and attacks can be lowered/stopped. 

You can also apply a rate limit where users are only able to send requests every
interval of time.
