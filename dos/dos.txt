- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

The vulnerability here that the server will crash if the wrong input is passed. To fix this, 
we added a try catch where a bad input will not cause the server to crash. 

Additional securities we can add is to limit the amount of requests that can come into the
system. This will stop the system from being overwhelmed by requests. You can also add a 
capcha request where it can eliminate the bots that try to overwhelm the server with the
requests.
